This is a tutorial on Approximate Bayesian Inference and Mean Field Variational Bayesian methods in general. The tutorial is inspired by Tamara Broderick talk on ICLR 2018 (Available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Moo4-KR5qNg). Further, In the PDF/Latex files I used many ideas from Bishop machine learning book. The Jupyter notebook is also implements a MFVB algorithm explained in Bishop on a Mixture of Gaussians model. The code is essentially borrowed from https://github.com/jamesmcinerney/vbmm.
